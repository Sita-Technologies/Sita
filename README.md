The decompiler is in an early stage of development. As of now, it can read the basic Outline structure of standard applications and decompile some basic operations. Only 32bit Team Developer applications are supported yet. Not all language features, variable names, etc. are decompiled correctly.

Currently, TD 5.1 â€“ 7.4 are supported.
